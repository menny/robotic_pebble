# Robotic Pebble

With the discontinuing of Pebble web-services, the usability of Pebble watches dropped. Fortunately, [Rebble](https://rebble.io) can fix that! 
</br>
This Android app will help you, the discouraged Pebble owner, in setting up your Pebble to use Rebble web-services.

## Features:

* A complete, managed, Pebble set-up process with Rebble web-services.
* Quick links to Right-to-Left support firmware.
* Includes a file proxy service to handle uploading firmware and language-packs to the Pebble app on newer Android devices.
